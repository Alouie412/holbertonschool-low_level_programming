This directory contains files that correspond to Holberton School's project task 0x02. C - Functions, nested loops

holberton.h: This is the header file containing function prototypes needed for all projects within this directory.

0-holberton.c: This file contains a C program that prints out a word using _putchar, a customized "clone" of the putchar command.

1-alphabet.c: This file contains a C program that prints out all letters of the alphabet in lowercase using _putchar.

2-print_alphabet_x10.c: This file contains a C program that prints out all letters of the alphabet in lowercase, ten times, using _putchar.

3-islower.c: This file contains a C program that checks whether the input is a lowercase alphabet and returns either a true or false statement.

4-isalpha.c: This file contains a C program that checks whether the input is an alphabetical character and returns either a true or false statement.

5-sign.c: This file contains a C program that checks whether the input is a positive, negative, or 0, number, then prints out the sign as well as a value that corresponds to the sign. For example, if the input is 98, the output should be + and 1, indicating positive.

6-abs.c: This file contains a C program that takes an input and returns the absolute value (in other words, positive value) of the input.

7-print_last_digit.c: This file contains a C program that takes an input and prints the last digit of the input.

8-24_hours.c: This file contains a C program that prints out every minute of the day. Jack Bauer approved.

9-times_table.c: This file contains a C program that not only prints out the times table, but indents the table such that the last digit of the values align. This prints out the 9 times table.

10-add.c: This file contains a C program that returns the sum of two inputs.

11-print_to_98.c: This file contains a C program that either counts up or counts down depending on input. Either way, counting stops at 98.

100-times_table.c: This file contains a C program that not only prints out the times table, but indents the table such that the last digit of the values align. Unlike 9-times_table.c, this program takes in any value between 0 and 15 and prints out the times tables of the inputting value.

101-natural.c: This file contains a C program that prints the sum of all multiples of 3 or 5 excluding 1024. As added insurance this program also handles numbers that are multiples of 3 and 5.

102-fibonacci.c: This file contains a C program that prints the first 50 Fibonacchi numbers, starting with 1 and 2, all separated by a comma and space.
