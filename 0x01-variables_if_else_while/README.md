This directory contains files that correspond to Holberton School's project task 0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while

0-positive_or_negative.c: This file contains a C program that takes in a randomly generated number and determines whether the input is a positive, negative, or 0, number.

1-last_digit.c: This file contains a C program that takes in a randomly generated number and determines whether the last digit of the number is greater than 5, is 0, or less than 6 and not 0.

2-print_alphabet.c: This file contains a C program that prints out every letter of the alphabet in lowercase, while not using printf or puts.

3-print_alphabets.c: This file contains a C program that prints out every letter of the alphabet in lowercase, followed by uppercase, all while not using printf or puts.

4-print_alphabt.c: This file contains a C program that prints out every letter of the alphabet except q and e, while not using printf or puts.

5-print_numbers.c: This file contains a C program that prints out all single digit numbers, including 0.

6-print_numberz.c: This file contains a C program that prints out all single digit numbers, including 0. Unlike 5-prnt_numbers.c, this file utilizes putchar.

7-print_tebahpla.c: This file contains a C program that prints out every letter of the alphabet in lowercase, in reverse, all while not using printf or puts.

8-print_base16.c: This file contains a C program that prints out all the numbers of base 16, while not using printf or puts. There may be more elegant ways of doing this without hardcoding the values, but it works.

9-print_comb.c: This file contains a C program that prints out all single digit numbers, followed by a comma and space between each number, except for the very last number. This is done without using printf or puts.

10-print_comb2.c: This file contains a C program that prints out all 2 digit numbers from 00 to 99 (and handles instances of single digit numbers), separating each value with a comma and space, while not using printf or puts.

100-print_comb3.c: This file contains a C program that prints out all possible combinations of two digits, with a comma and space separating each number, except for the very last number, all while not using printf or puts. Forbidding for loops was a self-inflicted challenge.

101-print_comb4.c: This file contains a C program that prints out all possible combinations of three digits, with a comma and space separating each number, except for the very last number, all while not using printf or puts. Forbidding for loops was a self-inflicted challenge.

102-print_comb5.c: This file contains a C program that prints out all possible combinations of two two digit numbers, with a space separating the two numbers, and a comma and space separating each pair, all while not using printf or puts. While forbidding for loops was a self-inflicted challenge and was successfully completed, the self-imposed challenge was ultimately scrapped due to Holberton School rejecting the file because of style format.
